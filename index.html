									If you find yourself experiencing thoughts and emotions related to your physical appearance, it is possible that you are grappling with body image issues. As a result, everyday tasks like eating, getting dressed, or socializing with friends may become increasingly challenging.<br / >
									<br />
									These feelings can arise at any point in your life or persist over an extended period, but they are particularly common during puberty. The hormonal changes occurring during this phase make you more conscious of your appearance and more attentive to the bodies of others. These changes are a natural part of everyone's journey and can sometimes lead to feelings of being overwhelmed or anxious.
